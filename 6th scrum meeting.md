# Report:

In this meeting, we discussed about the new timing of each sprint, since we had an extension for the deadline of the project and developer team had problems in sprint 3 of the project, I extended deadline from 20 OCT to 24 OCT, which by then the sprint 3 should be done completely by both developer teams. The sprint 3 will be done by 24 OCT and uploaded to Github by each team, and working on sprint 4 will begin shortly afterwards. Deadline for sprint 4 is 26 OCT 2020.
